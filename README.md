# Lewis-Structure_Oxacids-and-Hidracids

Lewis_Structure generator for oxacids and hidracids with one central atom.
Made in Python usign the plotter tool Turtle.

Besides it only can generate oxacids and hidracids with one central atom, I believe the way it does the job it's good, mainly because of the symmetrical rule the program follows.
